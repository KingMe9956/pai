# Integrating with Third-Party Services

PAI supports easy integration for:

- Wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger)
- APIs (OpenAI, payment providers, analytics)
- Cloud and on-premise services

## Adding a New Integration

- Use `/integrations` as a base
- Register necessary environment variables in `.env`
- Update `integrations.md` with usage and test cases

## Example

- Configure Solana wallet: [instructions]
- Webhook/REST integration: code and flow sample
